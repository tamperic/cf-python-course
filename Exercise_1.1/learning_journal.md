## Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 

### Learning Goals
- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

### Reflection Questions
1. **In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?**

    Frontend web development means building the visible part of the app that the user sees and interacts with, such as colors, fonts, elements like buttons, navigation bar, etc. Backend web development means building the invisible functional part of the app, making everything work.
    If I’d work as a backend web developer I’d work on building databases, writing APIs, create a logic for user login and signup, managing data storage.


2. **Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?**

    “I think Python is a better choice because Python offers some features that JS also does (there are still some similarities between JS and Python). Both are scripting languages, have a strong community and good documentation, good readability, a lot of great and popular libraries and frameworks. But on the other hand, Python it’s easy to use and learn, which is very important for younger developers who have little or no experience with Python. It provides fast backend development, especially working with databases, data processing, etc.“

3. **Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?**


    1. For the beginning I want to learn the basics about Python, but later to write even more complex scripts.
    2. Get to know Python's most popular framework Django.
    3. Even after this achievement I would like to keep learning backend development using Python, and so prepare myself for future job offers as a young developer.
