# 2.1 Learning Journal 

## Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

### Learning Goals

* Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC  
* Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks   
* Install and get started with Django

### Reflection Questions

1. **Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?**

|  |  vanilla Python | Django |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Advantages** | \- Good control over the project, no strict rules in choosing the tools you want to work with. \- Good choice for smaller projects. \-Great documentation and community support. | \- Faster development thanks to built-in tools (authentication, database, etc.) \-Scales well for larger projects. \-Secure with built-in automated encryption. \-Great documentation and community support. |
| **Drawbacks** | \- Much more effort and time to add some features like managing user accounts, database, etc. \- Security and database connection has to be done manually. \- Not a good choice for larger projects, it’s difficult to maintain them. | \-No freedom to choose tools you would like to work with \- no flexibility. |

2. **In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?**

The **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** has a separate piece of code called **controller** that decides how the data (model) and the presentation (view) work together which can give more control, but also it means the developer needs to write more code which brings more complexity. On the other hand, in the **MVT (Model-View-Template)** the developer doesn’t have to write extra code, the “controller” part is automatically handled through the Django framework, which is much easier and quicker to work with.

3. **Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:**  
* **What do you want to learn about Django?** 

I want to learn Django basics, acquire a solid understanding of features \- models, views, templates \- how they work together and help to build a web app.

* **What do you want to get out of this Achievement?** 

I want to get out of this Achievement to acquire practical skills, so I can feel comfortable using Django in real projects in the future.

* **Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?** 

After this Achievement, I want to be ready to work on larger web applications, to finish my Job Preparation course, and to prepare my projects for the job search.
